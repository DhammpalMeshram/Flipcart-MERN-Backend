        description: "Longlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2023 ** In Stone Blind, the instant Sunday Times bestseller, Natalie Haynes brings the infamous Medusa to life as you have never seen her before. 'Witty, gripping, ruthless' - Margaret Atwood via Twitter 'Beautiful and moving' - Neil Gaiman via Twitter 'So to mortal men, we are monsters. Because of our flight, our strength. They fear us, so they call us monsters.' Medusa is the sole mortal in a family of gods. Growing up with her Gorgon sisters, she begins to realize that she is the only one who experiences change, the only one who can be hurt. And her mortal lifespan gives her an urgency that her family will never know. When the sea god Poseidon commits an unforgivable act in the temple of Athene, the goddess takes her revenge where she can - and Medusa is changed forever. Writhing snakes replace her hair, and her gaze now turns any living creature to stone. The power cannot be controlled: Medusa can look at nothing without destroying it. She is condemned to a life of shadows and darkness. Until Perseus embarks upon a quest to fetch the head of a Gorgon . . . Praise for Natalie Haynes, the Women's Prize-shortlisted author of A Thousand Ships: 'With her trademark passion, wit, and fierce feminism... her thoughtful portraits will linger with you long after the book is finished' - Madeline Miller, author of The Song of Achilles and Circe 'Haynes combines a wide-ranging knowledge of the original myths with a gift for compelling narrative' - The Times 'Natalie Haynes is both a witty and an erudite guide. She wears her extensive learning lightly and deftly drags the Classics into the modern world' - Kate Atkinson, author of Life After Life 'Haynes is master of her trade . . . She succeeds in breathing warm life into some of our oldest stories' - Telegraph 'Haynes is the nation's greatest muse' - Adam Rutherford",

She wrote about all her bitter experiences in the Swat Valley under the unreasonable power of the Taliban. The girls were deprived of education. Malala Yousafzai slowly made her presence felt through her regular appearances in international media. She supported freedom of education for everyone, especially for young girls and women in Swat Valley and across the world. In October 2011, Malala was shot while boarding her school bus. One of the bullets even went through her forehead and into her shoulder. But the brave heart survived the attack and came back even stronger. People from across the globe stood on her side of the battle. This book is the story of her indomitable strength, which has made her a global figure of sheer grit, peace, and hope.",

They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon... The prelude to The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit has sold many millions of copies since its publication in 1937, establishing itself as one of the most beloved and influential books of the twentieth century.",

However, on his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers a startling secret. He is not ordinary, and his parents didn’t die in an accident: they were murdered by a Dark Wizard who tried to murder Harry too, and failed. Harry is offered a place at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he journeys to the magical castle where he makes friends for life. However, Hogwarts is a dangerous place, and there are secrets at every turn. The Dark Wizard who tried to murder Harry is still alive, and he’s waiting for a chance to return and wreak havoc once again. His first objective will be the death of Harry Potter.

        description: "Longlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2023 ** In Stone Blind, the instant Sunday Times bestseller, Natalie Haynes brings the infamous Medusa to life as you have never seen her before. 'Witty, gripping, ruthless' - Margaret Atwood via Twitter 'Beautiful and moving' - Neil Gaiman via Twitter 'So to mortal men, we are monsters. Because of our flight, our strength. They fear us, so they call us monsters.' Medusa is the sole mortal in a family of gods. Growing up with her Gorgon sisters, she begins to realize that she is the only one who experiences change, the only one who can be hurt. And her mortal lifespan gives her an urgency that her family will never know. When the sea god Poseidon commits an unforgivable act in the temple of Athene, the goddess takes her revenge where she can - and Medusa is changed forever. Writhing snakes replace her hair, and her gaze now turns any living creature to stone. The power cannot be controlled: Medusa can look at nothing without destroying it. She is condemned to a life of shadows and darkness. Until Perseus embarks upon a quest to fetch the head of a Gorgon . . . Praise for Natalie Haynes, the Women's Prize-shortlisted author of A Thousand Ships: 'With her trademark passion, wit, and fierce feminism... her thoughtful portraits will linger with you long after the book is finished' - Madeline Miller, author of The Song of Achilles and Circe 'Haynes combines a wide-ranging knowledge of the original myths with a gift for compelling narrative' - The Times 'Natalie Haynes is both a witty and an erudite guide. She wears her extensive learning lightly and deftly drags the Classics into the modern world' - Kate Atkinson, author of Life After Life 'Haynes is master of her trade . . . She succeeds in breathing warm life into some of our oldest stories' - Telegraph 'Haynes is the nation's greatest muse' - Adam Rutherford",
